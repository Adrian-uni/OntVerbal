# OntVerbal


It is a multi-language verbalizer of ontologies written in Java, currently it has been adapted to verbalize any ontology in Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.


Usage:
        ./program  ontology_file  \t template_file  \t boolInference  \t boolTranslation
        
        if boolInference = 1 then we use inference on the ontology, other we do not.
        
        if boolTranslation = 1 then we use translation on the ontology, other we do not. It takes a lot of time.
